- Description
All the code are in one single index.html file. The parts that purely involves my own work is the animation part. I had to specify the orbiting track for each planet in my project. I used a data structure called group when creating the objects, so that I can update the position of each objects in the render() function. The rendering part were mostly done with the help of the Three js library. Rendering techniques I used include texture mapping, phong shading, shadowing, and some glowing effects. 

- How to run
cd to the src directory. 
In terminal, run the line of code: python -m http:server
Open the index.html in a browser.
